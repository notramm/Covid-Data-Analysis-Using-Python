> 📌 In this project, I collected reliable COVID-19 datasets from trusted sources and performed an in-depth analysis to gain insights into the pandemic. Here's how I approached it:

1. 📝Data Collection: Gathered relevant COVID-19 datasets from government health departments and trusted data repositories.
2. 🌐Data Cleaning and Preparation: Processed the data, handling missing values and ensuring suitable formats for analysis.
3. 🧹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn to explore and visualize the data, uncovering trends and patterns.
4. 🪄Feature Engineering: Created new features and derived meaningful metrics to enhance the analysis, such as daily new cases and growth rates.
5. ⚒️Statistical Analysis: Applied statistical techniques to identify correlations, perform hypothesis testing, and discover significant factors related to COVID-19 spread.
6. 📊Building the Dashboard in Power BI (Working on it).
